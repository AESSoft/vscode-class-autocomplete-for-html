## Known Issues
-	Extension can take even over 30 seconds to generate a class list when used in conjunction with frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Font Awesome etc. due to a large number of CSS classes.
-	Minified CSS may cause class list not to generate properly. (Please use uncompressed CSS for development.)
